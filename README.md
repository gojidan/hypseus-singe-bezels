# Collection of bezels for the Hypseus Singe games

The bezels are organized in this way:
- by emulator of origin
- by game
- by resolution

For example, a 1920x1080 bezel created for use with 
the Arcade version of Dragon's Lair will be found in 
the folder

daphne/dragons-lair/1920x1080/

Inside each game's folder, there is the authors.txt 
file, where the authors of the bezels are mentioned 
(if they could be located).

Any unnamed people who can prove that they are the 
authors of a bezel, are sent to write me privately 
on Discord and they will be added to the authors.txt 
file in the game folder.
