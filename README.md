# Collection of bezels for the Hypseus Singe games

The bezels are organized in this way:
- by emulator of origin
- by game
- by resolution

For example, a 1920x1080 bezel created for use with 
the Arcade version of Dragon's Lair will be found in 
the folder

daphne/dragons-lair/1920x1080/

Inside each game's folder, there is the authors.txt 
file, where the authors of the bezels are mentioned 
(if they could be located).

This is a list of some of the most representative 
authors of bezels for Hypseus Singe:

- PaCiFiKbAllA
- NeoKarnage
- Rhikki
- Widge
- Maximilium
- MBRetrocade6894
- TioTar
- MaX7o

Our thanks go to them for contributing with DirtBagXon 
to making lasergames immortal.
